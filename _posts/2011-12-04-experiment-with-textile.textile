To create HTML from markup we need two things. 

* A markup language
* A convertor from the markup to HTML

Searching the net gives us:
* "textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/: a simple formatting syntax.
* "markdown":http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/: both a simple formatting syntax and a tool to convert plain text to HTML
* "RedCloth":http://redcloth.org/: a Ruby module to convert textile text to HTML
* "kramdown":http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/: a Ruby library for parsing and converting a superset of Markdown.
* "rdiscount":http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/: a Ruby implementation of the Discount libary to parse Markdown syntax.
* "redcarpet":https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet: and yet another markdown parser.

This blog post was written in @textile@ and it was rendered with @RedCloth@

Side note: when writing blog texts in emacs it is best to turn off @Auto Fill Mode@. Because it completely messes up the generated text.
