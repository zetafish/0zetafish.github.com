Jekyll supports syntax highlighting out of the box. It uses pygments to do code syntax highlighting. "Here":http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/#syntax-highlighting I found some tips to setup coloring scheme for pygments.

On the "pygments":http://pygments.org/demo site you can play around with different coloring schemes to see how they look for a certain language. Once you have found a nice one create a @.css@ file for example:

{% highlight bash session %}
pygmentize -S emacs -f html -a .highlight > syntax.css 
{% endhighlight %}

And when I want to highlight a piece of Clojure code I get something like this:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn dup [x] 
   (+ x x))
{% endhighlight %}

-What I still don't get is that the background of the syntax blocks do
 not get the background of pygments. Maybe the @screen.css@ file is
 causing me trouble?-

It was indeed the @screen.css@. Next thing to do is to dig into CSS
and see what I can improve with the sheets on this blog. So far I like
the look and colors.
