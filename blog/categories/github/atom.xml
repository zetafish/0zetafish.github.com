    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I had a day off after a looooong day of traffic jams and a gig
at the <a href="http://www.odeondespiegel.nl/home">Odeon</a> theater in Zwolle.
Anyway having a day off does not mean no sitting behind the computer.
On the contrary, now that I have the time let's start hacking.</p>

<h3>Github</h3>

<p>First I started organizing my github projects. Some searching pointed
me in the direction of <em>Organizations</em>. A useful concept and it fitted
nicely with my plan of creating accounts per customer. So I created
some gmail accounts, one for each customer and then created parallel
accounts on github. Finally I moved the projects to the correct
organization.</p>

<h3>Personal domain</h3>

<p>Secondly I decided that it would be a cool idea to have a personal
domain point to my <a href="http://zetafish.github.com/">github blog</a> And what
I need for that is first a domain.</p>

<p>I registered the <code>endymionkasanardjo.nl</code> domain on
<a href="http://eksolutions.eu">eksolutions.eu</a> which seemed a sweet deal with
just 5 EURO for a year. However I did not immediately see how to setup
the forwarding. It turned out that forwarding costs an additional 2.40
EURO.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.godadday.com/">godaddy</a>. They offer a .info domain
for only 1.6 EURO a year. And what is more full access to DNS record
to manage forwarding myself.
<a href="http://www.google.com/support/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=58317&amp;topic=12451">Here</a>
I found out how to set up the CNAME record with godaddy.</p>

<p>Next I set up the CNAME file for my github blog. So that github knows
what to do when someone thinks they are talking to the
endymionkasanardjo.info domain</p>

<pre><code>echo endymionkasanardjo.info &gt;&gt; source/CNAME
rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>Yipeeeee. I am fully online now, and you can visit me on:</p>
